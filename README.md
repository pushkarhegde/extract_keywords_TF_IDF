# extract_keywords_TF_IDF

Keyword extraction is used to obtain the most used and most important words and expressions from a text. It helps to summarize the content of texts and recognize the main topics discussed.

Considering that more than 80% of the data we generate every day is unstructured, it is extremely difficult to analyze and process data. Keyword extraction helps in finding relevant keywords within massive sets of data (like new articles, papers, or journals) without having to actually read the entire content.
