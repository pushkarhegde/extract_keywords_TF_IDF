    "\n",
    "TF-IDF stands for term frequency–inverse document frequency, a formula that measures how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric calculates the number of times a word appears in a text (term frequency) and compares it with the inverse document frequency (how rare or common that word is in the entire data set).\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying these two quantities provides the TF-IDF score of a word in a document. The higher the score is, the more relevant the word is to the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is used primarily as a pre-processing step for tasks like clustering, topic modeling, and text classification. But TF-IDF can also be used to extract keywords from a document to get a sense of the content of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we are dealing with Wikipedia articles, we can use tf-idf to extract words that are unique to a given article. These keywords can then be used for text analysis when we look at these keywords in aggregate.\n",
